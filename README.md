Original Project from: Buzz (https://www.facebook.com/virgil.burger) 

works like this ,, you have normal manual mode in normal boot ,,

if you are in manual you have just up and down channel when preshing up and down ,,

if you hold middle pos button preshed you wil see BAND + 
if released there !
and you wil go one band up

if you hold it longer you wil see BAND - 
if released there !
and you wil go one band down


and if you hold longer you wil see SFAVO
here you can store the channel you are on to a FAV band channel.

you have 8 to store for fast acces ! 

and if you hold it longer ,, !! You wil get a menu !! yeaa this wil include
